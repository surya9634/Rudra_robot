# Rudra Robot - A Humanoid AI Experiment

**Rudra Robot** is an ambitious project focused on developing the software architecture for a humanoid robot, with capabilities to interact with humans in an intelligent, emotionally aware, and conversational manner. The project leverages modern artificial intelligence (AI), computer vision, and machine learning technologies to simulate human-like interactions through a digital platform. The ultimate goal is to explore the possibilities of creating a humanoid robot that can perform meaningful tasks, recognize emotions, engage in conversations, and respond intelligently to various stimuli.

The project is named "Rudra" after the powerful, mythological deity of destruction and transformation in Indian culture, symbolizing the project's transformative potential in the realm of humanoid robotics.

## Introduction

Humanoid robots have long been a dream for engineers and scientists, representing the pinnacle of AI and robotics development. Rudra Robot is an experiment in software design that lays the foundation for a humanoid robot, focusing on tasks such as emotion detection, conversational AI, and camera input processing.

The core vision behind Rudra Robot is to create a system that can recognize human emotions in real time, hold natural conversations, and provide assistance to users based on their mood and needs. By integrating AI, computer vision, and natural language processing (NLP), the robot can perform tasks that simulate human-like behavior and decision-making.

## Features

**Rudra Robot** comes packed with a variety of exciting features, making it an experimental powerhouse in humanoid robotics. Some of the standout features include:

### 1. Emotion Recognition via Webcam
Rudra Robot uses your device’s webcam to analyze facial expressions and determine the emotional state of the user. By employing computer vision and deep learning techniques, the robot can classify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and more.

### 2. Conversational AI
Leveraging -based language models, Rudra Robot engages in intelligent conversations with users. The AI is designed to comprehend user input, generate meaningful responses, and even offer advice or guidance on certain topics.

### 3. Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech
Rudra Robot integrates speech recognition and synthesis systems to allow users to communicate with the robot via voice commands. The robot listens to user inputs, converts them into text, processes them, and responds vocally.

### 4. Camera Input Processing
Using computer vision, Rudra Robot processes live camera input to detect faces, identify objects, and track user movements. This enables a more interactive experience, as the robot can respond to visual cues.

### 5. Human-Machine Interaction
The project aims to bridge the gap between human and machine interactions by simulating a humanoid assistant that can provide real-time feedback based on user emotions, voice inputs, and gestures.

### 6. Multilingual Support
Rudra Robot is designed to support multiple languages, enabling it to converse in English, Hindi, and other languages. This ensures inclusivity and a more natural user experience for people of different linguistic backgrounds.

### 7. Personality Customization
Users can customize the personality of the robot to suit their needs. This feature allows the robot to adopt various conversational styles, ranging from formal and professional to casual and friendly, depending on the user's preferences.

## Technologies Used

**Rudra Robot** employs a diverse array of cutting-edge technologies, including but not limited to:

- **Python**: The core programming language used for the entire project.
- **OpenCV**: Used for real-time emotion recognition and processing live video feeds from the camera.
- **DeepFace**: A Python library for deep learning-based facial recognition and emotion analysis.
- **PyAudio**: For capturing audio input and converting speech-to-text.
- **gTTS**: Google's Text-to-Speech API for generating voice responses.
- **Flask**: To serve the robot as a web-based application (if desired for expansion).
- **PyQt5**: For creating a GUI if the robot needs to be wrapped in a desktop application.

## Installation Guide

To get started with **Rudra Robot**, follow the installation instructions below:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/surya9634/Rudra_robot.git
    cd Rudra_robot
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    Rudra Robot requires several Python libraries. You can install them by running:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the main program**:
    Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the robot by running the following command:
    ```bash
    python src/main.py
    ```

## Usage

Once the robot is running, you can start interacting with it by using the following methods:

1. **Emotion Recognition**:
   The robot will automatically analyze your face using the webcam and display your emotional state.

2. **Conversational Interaction**:
   Speak into the microphone, and the robot will listen to you, process your speech, and respond with appropriate text and voice output.

3. **Text Commands**:
   You can also type in commands or questions in the terminal, and the robot will generate a response based on its llama model.

## Future Scope

**Rudra Robot** is a proof of concept that can be expanded in numerous ways, including:

- **Hardware Integration**: Adding support for physical humanoid robots by integrating with platforms like Raspberry Pi, Arduino, or robotic kits.
- **Advanced Emotion Detection**: Enhancing emotion recognition by training models to detect complex emotional states and blending them with contextual responses.
- **Gesture Recognition**: Expanding the camera input processing to recognize hand gestures, body posture, and movements.
- **Task Automation**: Enabling the robot to perform tasks such as setting reminders, controlling smart home devices, or providing recommendations based on user preferences.
- **Full Humanoid Simulation**: Creating a complete humanoid model that can move, walk, and interact physically using robotic arms and limbs.
