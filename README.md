It is wonder to have a Humanoid robot, but is it possible ?

Suraj Sharma presenting you :

Rudra The Humanoid Robot....

Rudra a humanoid robot can have human copy functions some of those functions are:

â€¢ Walking

â€¢ conversation

â€¢ vision

â€¢ human like body 

these are some of the important functions of our humanoid robot that make it fully functional humanoid robot which have Realtime vision system can walk using command and have Realtime knowledge of real world makes it to access web.

As we know if we are making machine or robot it should have purpose for helping human :

â€¢ it can talk to humans in friendly way which can help them from depression 

â€¢ Although most of the time kids need ai based because they have curiosity to know something so it can help them too

â€¢ can help user to watch something

â€¢ can help user to automate anything

â€¢ Human like body helps to make you consider it as a human friend not a robot

â€¢ Can help senior citizen and talk to them too

â€¢ Some more functions are given in next point

# BTW it have doctor ai integrated which can make us talk to one of the virtual doctor based on artificial intelligence which can help us to give solution for our disease that is quite good

# Some more functions are given here :

â€¢ Time remainder 

â€¢ Weather notifier 

â€¢ Tell you Date and time

â€¢ Emotion detection

â€¢ Although AI have no emotion but still it can give you emotionally connected replies

â€¢ Can update you with News

â€¢ Have skin cancer detection 

â€¢ Can simplify and give conclusion for you of a youtube video

And goes on.....

â€¢ And the best thing it gives you happiness ðŸ˜Š


THANK TO YOU ALL || INFINITY

## Installation Guide

To get started with **Rudra Robot**, follow the installation instructions below:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/surya9634/Rudra_robot.git
    cd Rudra_robot
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    Rudra Robot requires several Python libraries. You can install them by running:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the main program**:
    Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the robot by running the following command:
    ```bash
    python src/main.py
    ```

## Usage

Once the robot is running, you can start interacting with it by using the following methods:

1. **Emotion Recognition**:
   The robot will automatically analyze your face using the webcam and display your emotional state.

2. **Conversational Interaction**:
   Speak into the microphone, and the robot will listen to you, process your speech, and respond with appropriate text and voice output.

3. **Text Commands**:
   You can also type in commands or questions in the terminal, and the robot will generate a response based on its llama model.

## Future Scope

**Rudra Robot** is a proof of concept that can be expanded in numerous ways, including:

- **Hardware Integration**: Adding support for physical humanoid robots by integrating with platforms like Raspberry Pi, Arduino, or robotic kits.
- **Advanced Emotion Detection**: Enhancing emotion recognition by training models to detect complex emotional states and blending them with contextual responses.
- **Gesture Recognition**: Expanding the camera input processing to recognize hand gestures, body posture, and movements.
- **Task Automation**: Enabling the robot to perform tasks such as setting reminders, controlling smart home devices, or providing recommendations based on user preferences.
- **Full Humanoid Simulation**: Creating a complete humanoid model that can move, walk, and interact physically using robotic arms and limbs.
- **BTW Guess What**: i have one of the humanoid robot available but we can even make that more advance
